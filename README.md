#Getting started with WebStorm
#Webstorm is an IDE developed by Jetbrains and its used for Javascript and Typescript developent. In order to get started with it you would have to download it and it has a familiar UI just like VS code (Virtual Studio). When you finally have it running you can either open, check out, or creat a project.
#Play around with the UI to get used to it and when you create your project you can choose which type of file (example html, json,javascript) you want it to be.
#Start coding and then run the file and that should be it

#Git defenitions

#A branch is the opposite thing of a repository and it allows you to work without changing the main or master side of things
#When you clone something on github you are essentially copying everything that is on the repository 
#A commit is like running a save file or a save state on github. You are saving your work and/or making changes
#Git Fetch is when you are getting the latest changes from the repository (there is also git pull as well)
#GIT is an open source code management systems and it keeps track of different code or text
#Github is like a dictonary or wiki for programmers. You are able to see, edit and access your files from anywhere
#Merge is when you take changes from one branch and merge it to another branch a useful tool
#A Merge Conflict happens when user 1 and user 2 are editing the same code/text on the branch and they arent pulling or pushing the changes so some versions may be old or outdated for one person and brand new for another
#Git push is when you are sending out the changes to github
#Git pull is when you are receiving the changes
#Git remote is a tool that is used when you want to host connections
#Git Repository is the .git file inside the project and it tracks everything you do on github
